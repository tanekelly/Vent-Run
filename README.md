An evil smoke from the vent is making the residents of 6 Halley's Lane go crazy. It's your job to descend the floors of the complex and beat them to their senses to save the day.

## Game Ideas
- Three main floors to explore and clear
- Fight corrupted residents to restore them to normal
- Various platforming mechanics and combat abilities
- Visit Pip the shop keeper between levels.

## Development
Currently in active development using Godot.

[More details coming soon]
